# Mapping_Earthquakes
The purpose of this project is to provide earthquake data and major earthquake data from the last 7 days.  We also want to have different filters to be able to see it from a satellite, streetview and also a dark view.  We are also going to show tectonic plate information so that users can see where the earthquakes are in relation to the plates.
